## Description 

This is a OpenGL implementation of popular game 2048.
I 've used C++ and OpenGL to write the code. One great
feature of this game is that we can play the game in any
dimension we like 2*2 or 4*4 or 8x8 or anything as long
as the matrix is square. It is still under development though.
